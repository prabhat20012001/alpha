      <p><font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;Investors often face challenges aligning portfolios with specific preferences or 
      regulatory constraints, such as avoiding commodities. Can machine learning offer a solution?
      <span id="dots48"></span><span id="more48">
      Using Graphical Models, we frame this
      as an inference problem to replicate a desired fund within set constraints. Our approach achieves a high correlation with 
      the target portfolio, allowing cost-effective replication. An example to decoding global macro hedge funds is provided.
      It shows very stable correlation emphasizing that the method is able to replicate the strategy even under some strong 
      investment constraints.

      <h3>Small Triumphs Over Large: Instances Where BERT-Based Fine-Tuned Models Surpass GPT-4 in Classification Tasks</h3>

      <p><font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;This paper demonstrates that in sentiment classification tasks, non-generative BERT models 
      with reduced numbers of parameters exhibit similar performance as generative Large Language Models (LLMs). 
      <span id="dots47"></span><span id="more47">
      More specifically, we compared FinBERT (110 million parameters) and FinDROBERTA (82.1 million parameters) with GPT-4 (at least more than 
      1 trillion parameters) on financial text classification, using our specially developed market-based dataset to fine-tune the models. 
      This approach yielded significant and uniform performance improvements across all models, indicating that correctly fine-tuned small
      models perform even better than a large generative model like GPT-4. Furthermore, the application of a bagging majority vote classifier 
      did not lead to any significant performance gains, suggesting similarities (or mathematically an absence of independence) of our models.
      This could indicate that these models process and classify financial sentiment similarly as the Condorcet Jury theorem is not validated.
      Our fine-tuned models are publicly accessible on Hugging Face for further research.

      when using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive from a sentiment score from a text.
      <span id="dots46"></span><span id="more46">
      After explaining why uncertainty on sentiment score is challenging, especially in the case of news sentiment analysis, we present 
      multiple prompts and an on-going research of a novel way to identify uncertainty in sentiment analysis. Our method computes the 
      correlation between the cumulative sentiment score over different time windows with important influenced factors and validate that
      a similar proportion of patterns exists, using a measure based on the distance of Quantiles of Correlation Matrices, called QCMDistance. 
      We apply this approach to see how sentiments in financial news are connected with changes in stock markets and to assess that a 
      common pattern exists with the produced sentiment score, establishing a moderate uncertainty of the resulted sentiment score.</span>

      <p><font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;This paper presents a new and effective methodology for decoding strategies in the 
      context of investment portfolios. The proposed approach relies on Dynamic Bayesian Graphical Models, which are powerful tools for
      capturing complex relationships and dependencies in data over time. 
      <span id="dots45"></span><span id="more45">
      Using these models, we can accurately decode the hidden strategy within the investment universe. By leveraging Dynamic Bayesian 
      Graphical Models, we calculate dynamic weights that exhibit the most stable allocation rules. Through extensive experimentation on
      various investment scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy in decoding strategies. The method’s reliance 
      on Dynamic Bayesian Graphical Models enables it to effectively uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the investment data, 
      leading to improved portfolio allocation decisions and robust generalization across different market conditions.</span>

      <p><font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;In this paper, we use a comprehensive dataset of daily Bloomberg Financial Market 
      Summaries spanning from 2010 to 2023, published by Yahoo Finance, CNews and multiple large financial medias, to determine how global news headlines may affect stock market movements.
      <span id="dots43"></span><span id="more43">
      To make this analysis more effective, we employed ChatGPT. First, from the vast pool of daily financial updates, we identify the 
      top global news headlines that could potentially have a significant influence on stock prices. Second, for each headline, we question
      ChatGPT to answer whether the news might lead to a rise, fall in stock prices or is indecisive. This two-stage method proves more 
      effective than posing a direct question to the entire text. By gathering ChatGPT’s predictions day by day, we formed an overall 
      market sentiment score. We transform this score into a practical investment strategy in the NASDAQ index, demonstrating the significance
      of minimizing noise in sentiment scores by initially accumulating and then detrending them. This approach showcases that ChatGPT’s 
      analysis of news headlines can provide valuable insights into future stock market behaviors and be a valuable tool to develop 
      intuitive NLP-driven investment strategies leveraging news predictive power.</span>

      <p><font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;Portfolio allocation, a key part of investment management, aims to balance risk and return.
      Traditional methodologies, rooted in modern portfolio theory, have been widely used for this purpose. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool to tackle these complex problems, 
      <span id="dots41"></span><span id="more41">
      allowing finding new solutions through a trial-and-error process. The central idea of this paper is to demonstrate that traditional 
      portfolio allocation strategies can be reframed in the DRL framework. It shows that a short-sighted agent, driven by immediate rewards
      and only considering the first two moments, converges to the Markowitz portfolio. By supplying this agent with more information, 
      such as contextual data and additional future rewards, the DRL model can outperform traditional methods, though this comes with 
      added complexity. Experiments confirm the usefulness of contextual data and show that DRL can improve traditional financial methods.</span>

      We developed a market-based large dataset that enabled us to fine-tune the models on a real-world ground truth. Utilizing a marketbased

      method provides a new solution for portfolio allocation. 
      <span id="dots36"></span><span id="more36">
      In the first part, we present how to apply DRL to portfolio allocation and take into account the 
      specific nature of financial time series. We introduce the concept of contextual variables allowing better learning.
      We change the cross-validation to a stepwise approach to ensure that the training data does not contain any future
      points compared to the validation and test data. We empirically show that DRL makes it possible to go beyond the 
      state of the art of portfolio allocation methods by finding portfolios better adapted to market conditions, 
      thanks to layers of convolutions allowing us to capture the dependence between market data and allocation decisions.
      We conclude this part with a model-based approach where DRL selects volatility-targeting models. In the second part,
      we present theoretical results justifying the DRL approach. We show how the DRL approach generalises classical portfolio theories. 
      We study how DRL methods achieve variance reduction. We find similarities between reinforcement learning and supervised learning.</span>

      <p><font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;Financial time series data is often imbalanced, with the majority of data points
      representing normal conditions and a small minority representing tail events, such as market crashes. This imbalance can make
      it difficult to train machine learning models to accurately predict tail events. 
      <span id="dots34"></span><span id="more34">     
      FSDA (Feature Selection and Data Augmentation) is a novel approach to tackling tail-event analysis in imbalanced time series data. FSDA first uses a feature selection algorithm to identify the most predictive features for tail data. These features may exhibit different sensitivities compared to the rest of the dataset, so it is important to select them carefully. Once the most predictive features have been identified, FSDA uses data augmentation to generate synthetic tail data. 
      Data augmentation is a conventional technique for handling imbalanced data, and it can be used to enhance the accuracy of machine learning regression methods. FSDA has been evaluated on a financial time series dataset, and it has been shown to consistently outperform feature selection (FS) and data augmentation (DA) methods across all percentiles ranging from 85 to 99. This demonstrates the efficacy of FSDA in managing imbalanced time series data and improving predictive accuracy.

        <font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;In the context of risk-based portfolio construction and pro-active risk management, 
        finding robust predictors of future realised volatility is paramount to achieving optimal performance.
        <span id="dots32"></span><span id="more32"> 
        Volatility has been documented in economics literature to exhibit pronounced persistence with clusters of high or low volatility regimes and 
        to mean-revert to a normal level, underpinning Nobel prize-winning work on Generalized Autoregressive Heteroskedastic (GARCH) models.
        From a Reinforcement Learning (RL) point of view, this process can be interpreted as a model-based RL approach where the goal 
        of the models is twofold: first, to represent the volatility dynamics and forecast its term structure and second, to compute
        a resulting allocation to match a given target volatility: hence the name ”volatility targeting method for risk-based portfolios”.
        However, the resulting volatility model-based RL approaches are hard to distinguish as each model results in similar performance 
         without a clear dominant one. We therefore present an innovative approach with an additional supervised learning step to predict
         the best model(s), based on historical performance ordering of RL models. Our contribution shows that adding a supervised learning overlay to decide which model(s) to use provides improvement over a naive benchmark consisting in averaging all RL models. A salient ingredient in this supervised learning task is to adaptively select features based on their significance, thanks to minimum importance filtering. This work extends our previous work on combining model-free and model-based RL. It mixes different types of learning procedures, namely model-based RL and supervised learning opening new doors to combine different machine learning approaches.

        <font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;Regime changes planning in financial markets is well known to be hard to explain and interpret. Can an asset manager ex-plain clearly the intuition of his regime changes prediction on equity market ? To answer this question, we consider a gradi-ent boosting decision trees (GBDT) approach to plan regime changes on S&P 500 from a set of 150 technical, fundamen-tal and macroeconomic features. We report an improved ac-curacy of GBDT over other machine learning (ML) methods on the S&P 500 futures prices.

          We show that retaining fewer and carefully selected features provides improvements across all ML approaches. Shapley values have recently been intro-duced from game theory to the field of ML. This approach allows a robust identification of the most important variables planning stock market crises, and of a local explanation of the crisis probability at each date, through a consistent features attribution. We apply this methodology to analyse in detail the March 2020 financial meltdown, for which the model of-fered a timely out of sample prediction. This analysis unveils in particular the contrarian predictive role of the tech equity sector before and after the crash.

        <span id="dots25"></span><span id="more25"> 
        The standard approach
        based on Markowitz or other more or less sophisticated financial
        rules aims to find the best portfolio allocation thanks to
        forecasted expected returns and risk but fails to fully relate
        market conditions to hedging strategies decision. In contrast,
        Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can tackle this challenge by
        creating a dynamic dependency between market information and
        hedging strategies allocation decisions. 
        In this paper, we present
        a realistic and augmented DRL framework that: (i) uses additional
        contextual information to decide an action, (ii) has a one period
        lag between observations and actions to account for one day lag
        turnover of common asset managers to rebalance their hedge, (iii)
        is fully tested in terms of stability and robustness thanks to a
        repetitive train test method called anchored walk forward
        training, similar in spirit to k fold cross validation for time
        series and (iv) allows managing leverage of our hedging strategy.
        Our experiment for an augmented asset manager interested in sizing
        and timing his hedges shows that our approach achieves superior
        returns and lower risk.</span>

        <font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has reached super
        human levels in complex tasks like game solving (Go, StarCraft
        II), and autonomous driving. However, it remains an open question
        whether DRL can reach human level in applications to financial
        problems
        <span id="dots24"></span><span id="more24"> 
         and in particular in detecting pattern crisis and
        consequently dis-investing. In this paper, we present an
        innovative DRL framework consisting in two subnetworks fed
        respectively with portfolio strategies past performances and
        standard deviations as well as additional contextual features.
        
        The second sub network plays an important role as it captures
        dependencies with common financial indicators features like risk
        aversion, economic surprise index and correlations between assets
        that allows taking into account context based information. We
        compare different network architectures either using layers of
        convolutions to reduce network’s complexity or LSTM block to
        capture time dependency and whether previous allocations is
        important in the modeling. We also use adversarial training to
        make the final model more robust. Results on test set show this
        approach substantially over-performs traditional portfolio

        <font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;While researchers in the asset management industry have
        mostly focused on techniques based on financial and risk planning
        techniques like Markowitz efficient frontier, minimum variance,
        maximum diversification or equal risk parity, in parallel, another
        community in machine learning has started working on reinforcement
        learning and more particularly deep reinforcement learning to
        solve other decision making problems for challenging tasks
        <span id="dots23"></span><span id="more23">
        like autonomous driving, robot learning, and on a more conceptual side
        games solving like Go. This paper aims to bridge the gap between
        these two approaches by showing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
        techniques can shed new lights on portfolio allocation thanks to a
        more general optimization setting that casts portfolio allocation
        as an optimal control problem that is not just a one-step
        optimization, but rather a continuous control optimization with a
        delayed reward. 
        The advantages are numerous: (i) DRL maps directly
        market conditions to actions by design and hence should adapt to
        changing environment, (ii) DRL does not rely on any traditional
        financial risk assumptions like that risk is represented by
        variance, (iii) DRL can incorporate additional data and be a multi
        inputs method as opposed to more traditional optimization methods.
        We present on an experiment some encouraging results using
        convolution networks.</span>

        <span id="dots22"></span><span id="more22">
        Despite the advent of
        representation learning and end-to-end approaches, mainly through
        deep learning, feature se- lection remains a key point in many
        machine learning scenarios. This paper introduces a new
        theoretically motivated method for feature se- lection. The
        approach thatfits within the family of embedded methods, casts the
        feature selection conundrum as a coordinate ascent optimiza- tion
        with variables dependencies materialized by block variables.
        
        Thanks to a limited number of iterations, it proves eficiency for
        gradient boost- ing methods, implemented with XGBoost. In case of
        convex and smooth functions, we are able to prove that the
        convergence rate is polynomial in terms of the dimension of the
        full features set. We provide comparisons with state of the art
        methods, Recursive Feature Elimination and Bi- nary Coordinate
        Ascent and show that this method is competitive when selecting
        some financial trades.

      <p><font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp;Reinforcement learning (RL) is about sequential decision
        making and is traditionally opposed to supervised learning (SL)
        and unsupervised learning (USL).
        <span id="dots13"></span><span id="more13">     
        In RL, given the current state,
        the agent makes a decision that may in uence the next state as
        opposed to SL where the next state remains the same, regardless of
        decisions taken. Although this difference is fundamental, SL and
        RL are not so different.         
        In particular, we emphasize in this paper
        that gradient policy methods can be cast as a SL problem where
        true label are replaced with discounted rewards. We pro- vide a
        simple experiment where we interchange label and pseudo rewards to
        show that SL techniques can be directly translated into RL
        methods.</span>

	    more and more advanced optimization techniques to find optimal hyper parameters. 
	    Whenever the objective function is non-convex, non continuous and with potentially

		and is supposed to be state of the art for general optimization program. However, it is far from being 
		optimal for discrete variables. In this paper, we extend the method to multivariate binomial correlated 
		distributions. For such a distribution, we show that it shares similar features to the multi variate normal: 
		independence and correlation is equivalent and correlation is efficiently modeled by interaction between different 
		variables. We discuss this distribution in the framework of the exponential family. We prove that the model can estimate 
		not only pairwise interactions among the two variables but also is capable of modeling higher order interactions. This allows 
		creating a version of CMA ES that can accommodate efficiently discrete variables. We provide the corresponding algorithm and conclude.</span>

      <p><font color="#E09003">Abstract:</font>&nbsp; In machine learning, Feature Selection 
	    (FS) is a major part of efficient algorithm. It fuels the algorithm and is the starting 
	    block for our prediction. In this paper, we present a new method, called Optimal Coordinate 
	    Ascent (OCA) that allows us selecting features among block and individual features. OCA relies 
	    on coordinate ascent to find an optimal solution for gradient boosting methods score
        <span id="dots07"></span><span id="more07">     
         (number of correctly classified samples). OCA takes into account the notion of dependencies 
		between variables forming blocks in our optimization. The coordinate ascent optimization solves 
		the issue of the NP hard original problem where the number of combinations rapidly explode making a 
		grid search unfeasible. It reduces considerably the number of iterations changing this NP hard problem 
		into a polynomial search one. OCA brings substantial differences and improvements compared to previous 
		coordinate ascent feature selection method: we group variables into block and individual variables instead 
		of a binary selection. Our initial guess is based on the k-best group variables making our initial point more 
		robust. We also introduced new stopping criteria making our optimization faster. We compare these two methods 
		on our data set. We found that our method outperforms the initial one. We also compare our method to the Recursive 
		Feature Elimination (RFE) method and find that OCA leads to the minimum feature set with the highest score. This is 
		a nice byproduct of our method as it provides empirically the most compact data set with optimal performance. </span>
